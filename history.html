Here is one of his first ever training lessons, the world-famous Lecture Clash training:</p>

<h3>Anyone got a lecture clash? They're not pretty, but with your help, they can be manageable. Here are some thoughts on how to deal with it: </h3>
<ul>
<div class="list">
	<li>Realise that it's up to you. You are responsible for making it work.</li>
	<li>Attend one lecture and get the notes from the other (start with the web notes, but that's not enough). </li>
	<li>Find a friend in the one you miss and get them to tell you what else was covered in class that's not on the web.</li>
	<li>Which one do you miss?</li>
</div></ul>

<h4>Some ideas to help you with that decision are: </h4>



<ul>
<div class="list">	
	<li>If you miss one out of two lectures for a subject, that's 50%. If you miss one out of 3 that's 33%.</li> 
	<li>Which one are you most on top of?</li> 
	<li>Which subject has the most complete lecture notes?</li>
	</div></ul>
